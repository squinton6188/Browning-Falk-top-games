Browning was 22 of 28 for 304 yards and a school record six touchdown passes as the Huskies emphatically snapped a 12-game losing streak to the Ducks. He also ran for two scores, pointing his left index finger at a Ducks defender after his first rushing TD and drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty.\n",
